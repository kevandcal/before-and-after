# Before and After: Bike Ride in Kreuzberg in 1985 vs. 2018

This is a small jQuery project from my time as a student at [SPICED Academy](https://spiced.academy/program/full-stack-web-development/) that makes use of resizable panes. It displays two overlain photographs of the same place taken from the same perspective but many years apart. By dragging a bar in the middle of the frame to the left or right, users can reveal or hide either photograph, creating an interactive before-and-after effect.
